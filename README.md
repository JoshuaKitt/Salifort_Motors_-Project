## Project Title 
Salifort Motors - Employee Retention Model
## Project Overview
Machine learning algorithms to forecast potential employee resignations
## Business Understanding
Company is trying to increase employee satisfaction and prevent employees from leaving the company.
## Data Understanding
Data used was collected from the HR team which includes satisfaction Level, evaluation Score, average monthly hours worked and number of projects assigned to an employee.
## Model and Evaluation
I have tried to use and compare Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models to create a model that produces the best results. After the first round of modelling, feature engineering helped improve the scores of the models with the random forest being the champion model.
## Conclusion
Employees are this company are overworked severly and rarely get promoted within the company. Highest rate of resignation occurs around the 4 year mark with the average employee working 201 hours per month.
